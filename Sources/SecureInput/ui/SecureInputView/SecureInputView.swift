/**
 * Great for single-line-password-fields
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è add abstract
 * - Description: A SwiftUI view for secure single-line password fields,
 *               suitable for authentication and grant purposes. It does 
 *               not work with vertical axis text fields and may clear 
 *               text when toggling from unsecured to secure mode. This 
 *               view is used in `MasterPassView` and provides notes on 
 *               secure input, cursor management, and potential 
 *               improvements.
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Suitable for auth / grant. Not for storing passwords
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è This does not work with vertical axis textfield
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è The text will be cleared if the user continue to 
 *               write in secure mode after toggeling from unsecured 
 *               mode. This isnt such an issue when used in auth / 
 *               verify prompts, but can be if this field is to store 
 *               a password etc.
 * - Note: Used in: `MasterPassView`
 * - Note: Discusses secure input: 
 *         https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63095851/show-hide-password-how-can-i-add-this-feature
 * - Note: using opacity avoids resetting text when toggle, but cursor 
 *         pointer is lost, minor annoyance
 * - Note: Using `focusState` avoids cursor loss, but resets input, no go
 * - Note: To avoid keyboard loss between toggles see: 
 *         https://softwareanders.com/swiftui-password-show-and-hide/
 * - Note: Supports showing the last chracter you type: (very advance 
 *         solution) https://github.com/perfaram/TogglableSecureField
 * - Note: This component is utilized in views requiring secure text 
 *         entry, such as login, registration, and password update 
 *         forms within the ExampleApp.
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è It might be possible to fix the clear issue, by storing text temp, and detect if text is cleared etc, try to fix this later etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Maybe us if else with focused instead of using opacity, see the stackoverflow discussion etc
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è We can also use UIPresentable and use the old secure-text-field code from legacy etc üëà
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è describe how the isSecure value toggles the focus bools?
