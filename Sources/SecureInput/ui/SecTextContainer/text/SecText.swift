/**
 * - Description: `SecText` is a SwiftUI view that 
 *                conditionally displays text as either 
 *                plain or obscured based on the 
 *                `isSecured` binding. It supports a 
 *                placeholder when the text is empty and 
 *                uses an `AttributedString` to allow for 
 *                rich text presentation.
 * - Note: TextEditor doesn't support AttributedString

 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Tweak the colors
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Using observedobject could actually be the best solution here if it reacts on multiple values so isVisible and str change. try it!
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Potentially only use this for the passgenview üëà
